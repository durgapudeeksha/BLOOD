# BLOOD
The process of managing the blood bag that is received from the blood donation events needs a proper and systematic management. The blood bag must be handled with care and treated thoroughly as it is related to someoneâ€™s life. The development of Web-based Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is proposed to provide a management functional to the blood bank in order to handle the blood bag.
A person can Donate or Request for the blood bag using our Blood Bank Management System.
